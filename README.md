PIRANHA - APT Threat Intelligence & IOC Correlation Tool
Overview
PIRANHA is a cyber threat intelligence tool designed to map MITRE ATT&CK techniques used by Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) to relevant Indicators of Compromise (IOCs). This tool automatically analyzes descriptions of APT tactics and techniques, extracts meaningful keywords, and generates custom threat reports with detection tools and IOCs.

üöÄ Features
‚úÖ APT Technique Mapping - Retrieve techniques used by APT groups from MITRE ATT&CK datasets.
‚úÖ APT-Specific Descriptions - Uses APT-specific JSON data for more accurate descriptions.
‚úÖ Keyword-Based IOC Mapping - Maps keywords in descriptions to pre-defined IOCs.
‚úÖ Multi-Dataset Support - Supports Enterprise, Mobile, and ICS ATT&CK datasets.
‚úÖ Dynamic Keyword Management - Add new keywords, IOCs, and detection tools manually.
‚úÖ Export Reports - Generate Excel reports with categorized threat intelligence data.
‚úÖ Fully Scrollable UI - Navigate easily through large datasets with a scrollable interface.
